In my spare time I like to play music as well as to talk, read and write about music. 

I recorded a CD, available in Spotify, with a compilation of works for saxophone and piano by Eug√®ne Bozza. You can listen to it here: [spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/album/1trG4jSg5FkegeBfbXVidx?si=VPMFWLQkQquMGZ7sOFnC_A), [tidal link](https://tidal.com/browse/album/218713426).

I also like to write about concerts. You can read my critics here: [https://sineris.es](https://sineris.es/author/yuriko-baba-dagostino).
